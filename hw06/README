Build
------
run `make` to build this homework, all executable will be compiled.
BTW, the Makefile is extremely compact and FABULOUS, it output all its object file to temp dir to keep the work directory clean and nice. Please check it out. >.<

Also, `make clean` is supported.
** Warning ** Please note that the header files are not in makefile dependency list due to my laziness. This means any change of header file won't make the build system rebuild the associated files, you need to trigger it manully by doing `make clean` and rebuild the projects.
[tip] Only rebuild the target you need!

Run
-------
All executable accept no argument and can simply run in POSIX supported systems.

h0605
-------
Note that this program won't terminate when ouput warning! But fatal error did terminate the program.

Also the implementation of main function is just an art in comparison to the recommended implementation. Please check it out!
