Build
------
run `make` to build this homework, all executable will be compiled.
BTW, the Makefile is extremely compact and FABULOUS, it output all its object file to temp dir to keep the work directory nice and clean.
Please check it out. >.<

Also, `make clean` is supported.

Run
-------
All executable accept no argument and can simply run in POSIX supported systems.

Hw0101
-------
The input must be terminated with '00'. Otherwise the behaviour is not guaranteed. (Though I made it gracefully ends without error message.)
The input content after '00' is ignored.

Hw0104
-------
The JSON parser's valid input is a subset of the FRC 4627. The difference is described below:
1. There must contain a root object (due to the CLI specification)
2. The Name of the value does not contain '.', '[' and ']'
3. excess ',' in array is not valid
4. Newline character will cause error instead of being ignored.
Therefore, input only contain one valid JSON value (except object) with no root object is not valid.
The input is not checked and will cause undefined behaviour (even crash without error message).
The program behaviour is guaranteed only when input is valid.

Also, the query is done with a FABULOUS hand crafted hash map which cost about double memory space and run at merely same speed in contrast to C++ unordered_map.
Please check it out.
